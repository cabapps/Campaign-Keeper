# Campaign-Keeper
A system to help GMs track tabletop rpg campaigns. The system will have the following features 

- A Universal Windows App for the DM to use to update his/her campaign.
- A Web Api for the DM to push his/her campaign updates to the cloud.
- A web app for players to be able to see the latest updates from the DM.
- A PCL used by the three apps above.
 
Eventually it would be nice to have an Android/iPhone client for players to use. The PCL is targeted to use Xamarin for Android/iPhone development. Feel free to branch and start working on that if you'd like.
